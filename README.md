Code and supplementary materials for reimplementation of paper **"A Stationary SVBRDF Material Modeling Method Based on Discrete Microsurface "**
## Code
For __preprocessing__ process, __preprocesscv.cpp__ is provided based on opencv, and __preprocessexr.cpp__ is provided based on openexr.  

For __rendering__ process, I integrate our SVBRDF model in Mitsuba framework. For wider application for all readers, I provide the detailed pseudocode.


If you need the __rendering__ code of Mitsuba please contact me, my email address is annie082795@126.com
## Supplementary Materials
We also provide some test samples include the small-sized sample normal maps and large-sized normal maps and the shoes model.
